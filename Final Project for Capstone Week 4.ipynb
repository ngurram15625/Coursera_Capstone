    "The city of Detroit, Michigan is seemingly trying to get back on the upswing and improve as a city. With this realization, restaurant companies, especially those which wouldn't be considered common such as cuisines from foreign countries, could very well be looking to find a place in Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) to take advantage of the high population and bolster their revenues. An increase in the number of restaurants in the DMA could not only allow for variety of restaurants that Detroiters can go to but also could help with increasing employment to provide more jobs in the DMA for those who may be unemployed. With this growth in the restaurant industry, this could supplement the growth of other industries in the DMA, such as tourism, as those go hand in hand."

I had to web scrape data from websites pertaining to cities in [Macomb](https://geographic.org/streetview/usa/mi/macomb/index.html), [Oakland](https://geographic.org/streetview/usa/mi/oakland/index.html), and [Wayne](https://geographic.org/streetview/usa/mi/wayne/index.html) Counties. The information on the three websites were consistent in that all were under an unordered list (ul) tag, so I could create code that would extract the cities from each of the three counties."

This can be determined by first ensuring that the latitude is at least 41 and at most 43 and longitude is at least -84 and at most -82. Then, from a manual check, we can see that all the latitudes and longitudes seem proper. Alternatively, we could have manually replaced the coordinates that were wrong with the correct ones, but decided to go with the former method simply to ensure all data was coming from the same source.\n",
